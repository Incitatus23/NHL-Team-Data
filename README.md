# Project Description
Using NHL data from 1979 to 2024, the purpose of this project was to analyze NHL trends by team, decade, and year for stats such as goals scored per game, goals
allowed per game, penalty kill percentage, powerplay percentage, and points percentage. Code for Plotly Dash app - an interative dashboard - is included as well.
Data was complied with 3 weeks left of the 2023-2024 regular season, so the final numbers will differ slightly.
